To proceed with finding the Environmental Impact Statement report for the Jamaica Bus Depot expansion, we need to explore sections of the website that typically contain such documents. Based on the provided accessibility tree, the links under 'Transparency' and 'Projects' are most likely to contain this type of information.

Currently, the 'Transparency' link ([13]) seems to be a direct choice as it usually includes reports and other formal documents related to operational transparency and could include environmental impact statements.

I will click on the 'Transparency' link to navigate further in search of the document.

Based on the current accessibility tree, the most direct way to search for the Jamaica Bus Depot expansion information would be to use the "Search Projects" input and button.

Based on the current Google search results displayed in the accessibility tree and the screenshot, there are several listings for Honda Crosstour vehicles from the years 2012 to 2014, but it appears none of them strictly meet the criteria of being a 2012 to 2013 model, under $25,000, with the lowest mileage, specifically near the 49102 ZIP code. The closest options provided are from various dealers listed on Autotrader, Carfax, and CarGurus, among other platforms.

However, to directly address the user's request, it seems pertinent to follow a link that leads directly to the CarGurus website where more specific filters can be applied to refine the search according to the requirements of year, price, mileage, and location. The CarGurus links available in the accessibility tree point to a 2014 model, which is not within the specified year range. Therefore, the best course of action is to go to the CarGurus homepage and manually enter the search criteria there.

To proceed, I will take the action of clicking on the link that navigates to CarGurus, choosing one of the links for a Honda Crosstour from CarGurus to get to the website where more specific search options can be set. This allows for a more targeted search.

Based on the accessibility tree and the current screenshot, I notice that there are listings for various Honda Crosstour models from different years. To find the lowest mileage used Honda Crosstour from 2012 to 2013 near the ZIP code 49102 and under $25,000, we need to filter the search results further or navigate to a more detailed search page that allows entering specific criteria.

From the accessibility tree, the options available do not directly indicate a search form or specific filter controls. However, there are links to individual car listings such as the "2012 Honda Crosstour EX-L V6" and others. Since the user needs the lowest mileage within a specific price range and near a specific ZIP, refining the search criteria is crucial.

To proceed, I should check the link for the 2012 Honda Crosstour EX-L V6, which might lead to a more detailed page where we can potentially adjust the search criteria or at least gather more information about this particular model's mileage and pricing near the specified ZIP code.

Based on the provided accessibility tree, it appears that the specific search or filtering options needed to enter criteria such as year, mileage, price, and location are not directly visible in the tree. The next logical step would be to either find the search or filtering interface on the CarGurus website, or navigate to a section that might contain these options.

Let's attempt to navigate to the "Used cars" link which could potentially lead to a page where we can specify search filters for the Honda Crosstour.

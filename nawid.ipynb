    "The agent seems to handle well with navigating from one page to another. The Planner and Evaluator work cohesively to propogate agent towards the right direction, resulting in lower time steps when Evaluator is used compared to not being used. They seem to falter upon sign-up forms, access denied pages and other dead-end situations. It also hits dead-ends when it hits pages that it cannot fill up such as custom search boxes or other custom UI elements. Another situation that occurs is during the dead-ends the agent tends to not perform any action but rather hallucinate itself into creating a mock-up plan. In essence, the agent creates data for itself and suggests actions to take on make shift information. This can be seen in the task where in Kohl's website they search for swimsuits. \n",

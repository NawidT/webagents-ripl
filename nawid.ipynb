    "The agent seems to handle well with navigating from one page to another. The Planner and Evaluator work cohesively to propogate agent towards the right direction, resulting in lower time steps when Evaluator is used compared to not being used. They seem to falter upon sign-up forms, access denied pages and other dead-end situations. It also hits dead-ends when it hits pages that it cannot fill up such as custom search boxes or other custom UI elements. Another situation that occurs is during the dead-ends the agent tends to not perform any action but rather hallucinate itself into creating a mock-up plan. In essence, the agent creates data for itself and suggests actions to take on make shift information. This can be seen in the task where in Kohl's website they search for swimsuits. \n",

    "## Language + Vision: d_v (dom + vision) mode + no global reward\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of vision improves the performance on dead-end situations. It handles access denied pages and pop-ups much better than the DOM-only approach. There also seems to be a disparity where the DOM approach finds elements that aren't in the view of the screenshot, so instead of scrolling down, buttons are pressed. In the planning response there seems to be an emphasis on the screenshot and ample use of previous steps. This method is also considerably slower given the screenshots. \n",

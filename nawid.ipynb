It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1.

Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

I will click \\'Store Details\\' for Howell Mill - GameStop to check for a \\'Set as Home Store\\' option on the store\\'s details page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query.

I will click the \\'Set as Home Store\\' link for the first store listed, Howell Mill - GameStop., Action: On the GameStop store locator page, I am clicking the \\'Set as Home Store\\' link (element_id 416) for the Howell Mill - GameStop location, which appears to be the closest to zip code 90028 based on the previous search., Reflection: \";\\nStep6:\"Thought: The accessibility tree shows that the previous action of clicking the \\'Set as Home Store\\' link for Howell Mill - GameStop might not have been successful, or that information is not directly available.

I will click \\'Store Details\\' for Howell Mill - GameStop to check for a \\'Set as Home Store\\' option on the store\\'s details page. If that doesn\\'t work, I will explore other options., Action: On the GameStop store locator page, I am clicking the \\'Store Details\\' link (element_id 415) for Howell Mill - GameStop to access more information about the store and look for a \\'Set as Home Store\\' option.

I will navigate back to the GameStop homepage and then to the store locator again., Action: Navigating from the GameStop homepage to the store locator page (https://www.gamestop.com/store-locator) to retry finding the closest GameStop to zip code 90028 and setting it as the home store., Reflection: \";\\nStep8:\"Thought: The accessibility tree shows only a single link with a \\'null\\' value, indicating I\\'m on the GameStop homepage and previous actions failed.

I will click \\'Store Details\\' for Howell Mill - GameStop to check for a \\'Set as Home Store\\' option on the store\\'s details page. If that doesn\\'t work, I will explore other options., Action: On the GameStop store locator page, I am clicking the \\'Store Details\\' link (element_id 415) for Howell Mill - GameStop to access more information about the store and look for a \\'Set as Home Store\\' option.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task.

This is impossible as the 40mm HE (High Explosive) rounds fired from this weapon do not arm themselves until they have traveled 30 meters (approx 90 feet). So the round would have simply dented the door or punched a 40mm size hole in it depending on the material the door was made of.\\'\\n                            [381] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [382] link \\'Quotes\\'\\n                                        [383] link \\'The Terminator\\'\\n                            [384] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [385] link \\'Crazy credits\\'\\n                            [386] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [387] link \\'Alternate versions\\'\\n                                [388] button \\'See more\\'\\n                                    [389] button \\'On the \\'Ultimate Edition\\' DVD as well as the \\'Skynet Edition\\' Blu-ray, there are three versions of the film, albeit only two at the menu, the Theatrical and Special Edition versions.

This is impossible as the 40mm HE (High Explosive) rounds fired from this weapon do not arm themselves until they have traveled 30 meters (approx 90 feet). So the round would have simply dented the door or punched a 40mm size hole in it depending on the material the door was made of.\\'\\n                            [382] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [383] link \\'Quotes\\'\\n                                        [384] link \\'The Terminator\\'\\n                            [385] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [386] link \\'Crazy credits\\'\\n                            [387] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [388] link \\'Alternate versions\\'\\n                                [389] button \\'See more\\'\\n                                    [390] button \\'On the \\'Ultimate Edition\\' DVD as well as the \\'Skynet Edition\\' Blu-ray, there are three versions of the film, albeit only two at the menu, the Theatrical and Special Edition versions.

This is impossible as the 40mm HE (High Explosive) rounds fired from this weapon do not arm themselves until they have traveled 30 meters (approx 90 feet). So the round would have simply dented the door or punched a 40mm size hole in it depending on the material the door was made of.\\'\\n                            [382] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [383] link \\'Quotes\\'\\n                                        [384] link \\'The Terminator\\'\\n                            [385] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [386] link \\'Crazy credits\\'\\n                            [387] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [388] link \\'Alternate versions\\'\\n                                [389] button \\'See more\\'\\n                                    [390] button \\'On the \\'Ultimate Edition\\' DVD as well as the \\'Skynet Edition\\' Blu-ray, there are three versions of the film, albeit only two at the menu, the Theatrical and Special Edition versions.

It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task.

This is impossible as the 40mm HE (High Explosive) rounds fired from this weapon do not arm themselves until they have traveled 30 meters (approx 90 feet). So the round would have simply dented the door or punched a 40mm size hole in it depending on the material the door was made of.\\'\\n                            [382] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [383] link \\'Quotes\\'\\n                                        [384] link \\'The Terminator\\'\\n                            [385] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [386] link \\'Crazy credits\\'\\n                            [387] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [388] link \\'Alternate versions\\'\\n                                [389] button \\'See more\\'\\n                                    [390] button \\'On the \\'Ultimate Edition\\' DVD as well as the \\'Skynet Edition\\' Blu-ray, there are three versions of the film, albeit only two at the menu, the Theatrical and Special Edition versions.

It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1.

This is impossible as the 40mm HE (High Explosive) rounds fired from this weapon do not arm themselves until they have traveled 30 meters (approx 90 feet). So the round would have simply dented the door or punched a 40mm size hole in it depending on the material the door was made of.\\'\\n                            [382] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [383] link \\'Quotes\\'\\n                                        [384] link \\'The Terminator\\'\\n                            [385] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [386] link \\'Crazy credits\\'\\n                            [387] link \\'See more\\'\\n                            [388] link \\'Alternate versions\\'\\n                                [389] button \\'See more\\'\\n                                    [390] button \\'On the \\'Ultimate Edition\\' DVD as well as the \\'Skynet Edition\\' Blu-ray, there are three versions of the film, albeit only two at the menu, the Theatrical and Special Edition versions.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2.

This is impossible as the 40mm HE (High Explosive) rounds fired from this weapon do not arm themselves until they have traveled 30 meters (approx 90 feet).

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task.

This is impossible as the 40mm HE (High Explosive) rounds fired from this weapon do not arm themselves until they have traveled 30 meters (approx 90 feet).

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1.

Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

      "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an assistant who not only helps to browse and operate web pages to achieve certain goals, but also needs to explore the information on the page to answer the questions raised by the target task. Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2.

Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

      "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an assistant who not only helps to browse and operate web pages to achieve certain goals, but also needs to explore the information on the page to answer the questions raised by the target task. Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task.

In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

I will click on that link to view the job openings., Action: On the MBTA Careers page, I am clicking on the link with element ID [239] which says \\'View MBTA job openings\\' to access the job listings., Reflection: \";\\nStep3:\"Thought: The accessibility tree shows a search input field. I will use this to filter jobs related to safety and with a salary above 100k., Action: On the MBTA Careers page, I am filling the search input field (element ID 19) with the search term \\'Safety 100000+\\' to find relevant job postings., Reflection: \";\\nStep4:\"Thought: The search has been performed, now I need to click the \\'Search\\' button to see the results., Action: On the MBTA Careers page, I am clicking the \\'Search\\' button (element ID 21) to view the search results for safety-related jobs with a salary above 100k., Reflection: \";\\nStep5:\"Thought: The search results are displayed.  I need to check if any of the safety-related jobs list a salary above 100k.  If so, I will then proceed to the application page for that job., Action: On the MBTA Careers page, I am clicking the \\'Search\\' button (element ID 21) to view the search results for safety-related jobs with a salary above 100k., Reflection: \";\\nStep6:\"Thought: The accessibility tree shows several job postings related to safety.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task.

In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task.

In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task.

In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

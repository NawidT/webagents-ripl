Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree. Input should be a string.\\n            - google_search: useful for when you need to use google to search something.\\n            - click: useful for when you need to click a button/link from accessibility tree.\\n            - select_option: useful for when you need to select a drop-down box value. When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1. In the initial step of a process or when there\\'s no preceding interaction history (i.e., the previous trace is empty). \\n                2. In situations where the accessibility tree is absent or not provided.\\n            - Your action should not be the same as last step\\'s action.\\n            - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element\\'s ID in the accessibility tree.\\n            - AVOID using the provided example\\'s element_id as your output.\\n            - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.\\n        \\n        **Special Circumstances Guidelines**:\\n            - When performing a search on a website, if you find the search results do not display sufficient content, consider simplifying or modifying your search query. Reducing the complexity of your search query or altering keywords may yield more comprehensive results.\\n        \\n        Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the `action`, `action_input` and `element_id` you provide.\\n        \\n        **Output Requirements**:\\n        - Ensure your output strictly adheres to the JSON blob format outlined below:\\n            \\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": ACTUAL_THOUGHT\\n                \"action\": ACTUAL_TOOLS,\\n                \"action_input\": ACTUAL_INPUT,\\n                \"element_id\": ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID,\\n                \"description\": ACTUAL_DESCRIPTION\\n            }\\n            ```\\n          \\n        - A VALID JSON BLOB EXAMPLE AS FELLOWS:\\n            ```\\n            {\\n                \"thought\": \"In order to complete this task,I need to go to the Google home page\",\\n                \"action\": \"click\", \\n                \"action_input\": \"button\",\\n                \"element_id\": \"236\",\\n                \"description\": \"Now I\\'m on Google\\'s main page.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1.

Please answer the following questions as much as possible.\\n        There are key information you will get:\\n        **Key Information**:\\n            - Previous trace: all thoughts, actions and reflections you have made historically.\\n            - Accessibility tree: characteristic expression of the current web page.\\n            \\n        **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:\\n            The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).\\n            - **Accessibility Tree Example**:\\n                Here is an example of an accessibility tree:\\n                ```\\n                current web tab name is \\'Google\\'\\n                    [40] link \\'About\\'\\n                    [41] link \\'Store\\'\\n                        [186] link \\'Gmail\\'\\n                        [187] link \\'Images\\'\\n                        [163] textarea \\'Search\\'\\n                        [236] button \\'See more\\'\\n                ```\\n        In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: \\'[40]\\' for the element\\'s element_id, \\'link\\' indicates the element is a link, and \\'About\\' for the content of the element.\\n        Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output!         \\n\\n        You should always consider previous and subsequent steps and what to do.\\n        **Thought Space**:\\n            - What action do you think is needed now to complete the task?\\n            - What\\'s the reason of taking that action?\\n        \\n        You have access to the following tools(helpful to interact with web page):\\n        **Execution Action Space**:\\n            - goto: useful for when you need visit a new link or a website, it will open a new tab.\\n            - fill_form: useful for when you need to fill out a form or input something from accessibility tree.

When you get (select and option) tags from the accessibility tree, you need to select the serial number(element_id) corresponding to the select tag, not the option, and select the most likely content corresponding to the option as Input.\\n            - go_back: useful when you find the current web page encounter some network error or you think the last step is not helpful.\\n            - cache_data: useful when you need to extract information from the page that you think is extremely valuable for completing the target task. It is not a direct answer to the target task, but it is extremely relevant to the target task. Subsequent actions may refer to this part of the information and return this information as input\\n            - get_final_answer: useful for when you think it is the answer to the target task and no other operations are required, Input should be a answer content.\\n        \\n        You also need to provide an effective description of the current execution action.\\n        A proper description contains:\\n            - What website it is; \\n            - Which action you choose; \\n            - REMEMBER DO NOT LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION EMPTY!\\n\\n        You have to follow the instructions or notes:\\n        **Important Notes**:\\n            - Under the following conditions, you are restricted to using the `google_search` or `goto` tools exclusively: \\n                1.
